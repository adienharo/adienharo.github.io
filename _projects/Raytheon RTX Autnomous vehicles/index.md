title: Raytheon Autonomous Vehicles Competition (RTX)
description:  
  The RTX competition requires two autonomous vehicles (UAV & UGV) to work in conjunction to deliver a medical payload. Our team needs to comply with two          challenges set by RTX to meet competition requirements. The first challenge requires our UAV to identify the correct payload delivery markers over a 30x30       yard football field. The second challenge will require the UGV to travel to the correct waypoints utilizing communication from challenge 1 and deliver the       first-aid kit autonomously.
